A small PHP Page to find a lunch location in WOB. Latest `master` running at [luncher.mvattersen.de](http://luncher.mvattersen.de/)


## Dependencies ##
* [PHP][]5.6


## Installation ##
Get last version from github.com by following command:
		
		git clone https://github.com/vaddi/luncher.git

Place the files on a folder into your Webspace and open the location in a Browser.


## Idea ##
The daily question, what do we eat today. Luncher is a pretty easy to use location finder, based on a static Array as data source. To change the locations, fit to your needs, simply edit the inc/data.php file for your needs. The Base locations are targeting to the area Wolfsburg City.

* Location finding
* Location listing depending on opening
* Simple filter buttons, to add conditions to show/hide entries
* Very user friendly by simple Structure and Usage

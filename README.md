## Idea ##
The daily question, what do we eat today. Luncher is a pretty easy to use location finder, based on a static Array as data source. To change the locations, fit to your needs, simply edit the inc/data.php file for your needs. The Base locations are targeting to the area Wolfsburg City.

* Location finding
* Location listing depending on opening
* Simple filter buttons, to add conditions to show/hide entries
* Very user friendly by simple Structure and Usage
